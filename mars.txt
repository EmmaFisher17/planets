Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
I'll be able to get 40 minutes extra sleep
Yeti will appreciate the cold
The polarcaps will probably be Yeti's home
This is a different change
New modification
